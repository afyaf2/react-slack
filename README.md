React Slack ~~ 

This is a chatroom app built with React, Node (Express.js) and Semantic UI - it also uses the Chatkit API (https://pusher.com/chatkit).

In this app, users are able to:
- Create a new user or use an existing name
- Join (subscribe) to any chat room
- Make a new chat room 
- See notifications (via a dynamic ribbon label) that other users in the same room are typing

Todo:
- Add a list of current online users to the UI

I'd like to thank chatkit, my keyboard and stackoverflow - all have been immensely helpful in the creation of this project.
